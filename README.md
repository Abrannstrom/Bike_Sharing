# Bike Sharing
## Overview of Project
Now that we've gotten a good idea of how to create our story, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:

  Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
  Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
  Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
  Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

## Resources:

* Data Source: `NYC_CitiBike_Challenge_starter_code.ipynb`, `NYC_Citibike_Challenge.ipynb` and `201908-citibike-tripdata.csv`
* Data Tools: Jupyter Notebook, CSV, and Tableau 
* Software: Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code 1.50.0


# Deliverable 2:

The trip durations show a right skew with a mode of 5 hours and 30 minutes.

The male curve more closely resembles the previous figure whereas the female distribution is more flat.

On weekdays, 8 am and 5 pm are popular times which makes sense because they're just outside of typical working hours.

The female and male distributions by hour are nearly identical.

This final figure brings together all of the previous relationships we've created.  The peak hours for each of the genders are very similar but the female distribution has a flatter curve than the male's.
